               <h3>Joy Division</h3>

               <p>Joy division were originally formed as 'Warsaw' they were planning to release an self-titled album in 1979 that was to be released through RCA recordings but the dissatisfaction with the outcome of the album allowed them to have it shelved and it wasnt released until 1994. Their next album would be released under their official name Joy Division as the ep 'An ideal for living' this ep would feature songs that would eventually be found on 'Unknown Pleasures' the band were initially influenced by british punk bands such as 'Sex Pisols' and the later 'Buzzcocks'. It wasnt until the insistance of factory records producer Martin Hennett where the bands well known direction within the Post-Punk genre of music began. Interestingly throughout the album there is a high punk energy but its contained within the confines of harmonic mininimalist sounds. This approach was used to reflect thematically and lyrically the emotions of the lead singer of Joy Division Ian Curtis. Many of the songs contains various themes that of an inner artists struggele with demons many that is expressed in starting songs 'Disorder' which deals with this internal struggle to find light in the menaingless of internal conflict, 'Day of the lords' (Losing sense of the safety of childhood') and 'Candidate' dealing with the duality of the demons we internally conflict with sonically the album whether though the drumming and the bass/guitar rhythm that helps propel the album along a punk rhythm but more or less contained builds a sense of realistic tension and foreboding dread of dealing with the internal conflict of struggling within.The the synth machines were essenatial element of 'Unknown-Pleasures' the as the album again brought in the sense of alienation like this struggle was one of a banal sense of everyday life. The reality we see through the lyrics and the music's overall impression a truly harrowing and wall of the insight of the mental traumas and disorder of lead singer Ian Curtis and his fight within. Another thing of note his life was marked by chronic depression and was afflicted with photosensitive epilepsy. At the time of Joy Division exisitence he had two lives the public stage prescence of leading Joy Division but the private life was marked by having a family with his wife Deborah Curtis who would recount her marriage with Ian Curtis in her memoir 'Touching From A Distance:Ian Curtis and Joy Division' None few albums would forever change and influence how I viewed Rock Music and its effect on the wider ethos of society. I remember listening to this album feeling this sense of dread and just this atmosphere and how it immersed me into this world not realising we were in a model of the raging struggle singer Ian Curtis was battling with prior to his suicide at age 23 the night before their US tour. It is remarkable even to this day that a rock album can still have this much impact on so many bands that I listen to. As someone who battled mental illness to this day, even though the landsscape the album created was in a sense bleak it awoken me to know I didn't go through mental health issues alone theere are myriads of artists who have struggled mentally and where some were able to find peace many succumbed to their struggle. I let that be a realization that no matter how alone I think I am in reality the majority of Americans are struggling internally but we as a society never recognize it or fail to recognize it as a serious issue that requires therapy.We live in a culture where normalcy is the status-quo and denial of 'issues' is permitted. This album showed me that the vulnerability of human beings is the ultimate display of your humanity. Being able to write an album truthfully and fully from your struggle is what this album will be rememebered to me for beyond the lyrics and music this album is to me an inspiration and its not some polished protools confession its honest true and direct with the internalistion and struggle we as people deal with mentally and are afraid to really confess.</p>
